                        <p><strong>Rights Regarding Consumer Credit Files Under State and Federal Law:</strong><br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Individuals have the right to challenge any inaccuracies found within their credit reports by directly engaging with the credit bureau. While this right is recognized, neither individuals nor ‘credit repair’ entities or organizations possess the right to remove accurate, current, and verifiable information from a credit report. A credit bureau is obligated to eliminate accurate, negative information from your report solely if such information has surpassed a 7-year duration. Information related to bankruptcy may be reported for a duration of 10 years.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Individuals are entitled to acquire a copy of their credit report from a credit bureau, which may entail a reasonable fee. Exceptions to this fee exist if an individual has been denied credit, employment, insurance, or a rental accommodation due to information present in their credit report within the preceding 60 days. Credit bureaus are required to assist in elucidating the information within your credit file. Eligibility for a complimentary copy of your credit report extends to individuals who are unemployed and anticipate seeking employment within the forthcoming 60 days, recipients of public welfare assistance, or those suspecting inaccuracies in their credit report due to fraudulent activity.</p>
                        <p>Legal recourse is available against credit repair organizations infringing upon the Credit Repair Organization Act, which outlaws deceptive practices.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Individuals maintain the right to rescind their contract with any credit repair organization within a 3-business day window from the contract’s signing date.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Credit bureaus are mandated to adhere to reasonable procedures to ascertain the accuracy of the reported information, albeit errors may transpire.</p>
                        <p>Individuals possess the right to independently notify a credit bureau in writing regarding any disputes over the accuracy of information within their credit file. Subsequently, the credit bureau is obliged to conduct a reinvestigation and rectify or eliminate any inaccurate or incomplete information, free of charge. It’s advisable to provide any relevant information and document copies concerning the error to the credit bureau.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Should the credit bureau’s reinvestigation fall short of resolving the dispute satisfactorily, individuals have the right to submit a concise statement to the credit bureau for inclusion in their file, elucidating the reasons behind their dispute of the record. Any report issued concerning the individual must encompass a summary of this statement regarding the disputed information.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the regulating body overseeing credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For further information, reach out to:<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />Public Reference Branch Federal Trade Commission Washington, D.C. 20580</p>

Upcreditshall use reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Service Suspension to Customer and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Services following any Service Suspension. Upcredit shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume providing access to the Services as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Service Suspension is cured. Upcreditwill have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits), or any other consequences that Customer or any Authorized User may incur as a result of a Service Suspension.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />(e) Aggregated Statistics.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by an Authorized User that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Customer will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. Customer shall use reasonable efforts to make all Authorized Users aware of this Agreement’s provisions as applicable to such Authorized User’s use of the Services, and shall cause Authorized Users to comply with such provisions.</p>

Each Party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first disclosed to the receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.</p>

The initial term of this Agreement begins on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to this Agreement’s express provisions, will continue in effect until one year from such date (the “Initial Term“).

This Section 10(d) and Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, 7(b), 8, 9, and 11 survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

                        <p>11. Miscellaneous.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" />(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference and all related Exhibits, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement, the related Exhibits, and any other documents incorporated herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs: (i) first, this Agreement, excluding its Exhibits; (ii) second, the Exhibits to this Agreement as of the Effective Date; and (iii) third, any other documents incorporated herein by reference.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" /></p><p>(b) Notices. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice“) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section).

In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, epidemic, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" /></p><p>(d) Amendment and Modification; Waiver.

No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving.

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.</p><p><br className="d-none d-lg-block" />(f) Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Delaware in each case located in the city of Wilmington and New Castle County, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.</p><p><br className="d-none d-lg-block" />(g) Assignment.

Each Party, agrees that neither it nor any of its respective agents, officers, key employees or directors, will in any way publicly disparage, call into disrepute, defame, slander or otherwise criticize the other Party or any of their products or services, in any manner that would damage the business or reputation or otherwise degrade the reputation of such other Party, their products, or their services in the community or in the debt repair industry.</p><p><br className="d-none d-lg-block" />(i) Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 4 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2(c), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.<br className="d-none d-lg-block" /></p><p>(j)Data Sharing with 3rd Party Affiliates.
